### 2. Before you code
To complete this lab, it's very important that you understand the example that we covered in the lecture, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
* json.loads
* json.dumps
* requests.post

### 3. The lab
In this lab, we will build a small app where people can submit a URL of an image, and using the Clarifai API, we will return what the image is about and return the results to the user.

This is pretty much the same functionality as clicking "Try your own Image.." button on this page https://clarifai.com/demo

* Look at the app.py and home.html. Run the `app.py` server (`python app.py`), go to your browser familiarize yourself with what is already provided for you.
* In app.py you'll need to code below where it says `YOUR CODE HERE!`
* You'll need an API key to authenticate with the Clarifai API we'll share this in class
* Build the dictionary for the data we want to send, this should be similar to the example we gave in class

If you have any questions ask an Instructor/TA

*BONUS*: Tell the user if the image provided has a human in it! Test that this works for different images that you provide!
*BONUS* *BONUS*: for an image provided, redirect the user to a Wikipedia page that is most relevant to what's in the image
